# Initial Request for Cloud Services

# Purpose

- define initial set of services and tools
- for access and distribution in the cloud
- development of Global ARD (Analysis Ready Data)

# Background

- Project to Modernize Landsat processing, access and distribution

## Goals

1. Save Money
2. Increase speed and agility of use of the data. - Meet community needs.
3. Enable full access including
- exploratory analysis
- large scale temporally deep data analysis
- tools for interactive access to pixel-level data

## Initial Planning
1. Scope, Schedule, Budget
2. Resources and Risks

## Deliverables
1. CONOPS
2. Project Requirements

## High Level Project Capabilities

1. Level1 Collection 1 in AWS Cloud
2. Pilot Collections 1 Global Level-2
- Migrate Level-2 algorithms to the cloud
    - note Sunne,Hedman - have this started in SGT cloud
3. ESPA on AWS
4. L0Ra on AWS - to support production of global ARD - Is this still a target?
5. Generate ARD from level 0 - using cloud infrastructure
6. Visualization - Enable visualization tools in the cloud. 
- ARD dashboards for scientists
7. Region of Interest - Pixel-level access 
- for example time-series - use ODC?
8. LCMAP - prototype the LCMAP work-flow in the cloud to enable generation of land change, cover and other info from ARD
9. Landfire - in the cloud - Out of scope for Tony
10. Replicate the Landsat Image Assessment System characterization very lareg database (VLDB) in the cloud

## Expertise

1. Research (Data Science)
2. DevOPS (Tony's core competency)
3. Operations

# Open Data Cube

1. ODC intends to promote exploitation of Earth observations data for societal benefit.

## Research Tasks
1. Is it feasible to use cloud object storage as a holding and access point for Data cubes?
2. Can use cases such as LCMAP run in the cloud?
    - 2a. Can they use all or part of the ODC code base?
3. Can ODC collections of data be exposed with standardized services in the cloud environment?

## Resources
1. TSSC shall provide a person to 
- work directly with the government
- and ODC partners to develop ODC software and tools
- visualize information products

## Expected Outcomes
- Notes from bi-weekly telecons
- ODC github contributions
- white papers of results for initial research tasks identified
- Monthly Progress Reports to USGS/GA
    - Monthly Steering Council attendance
- Prototype of the LCMAP use case
    - Initially pyCCD on ODC
